# Traffic-Management-System  

🚦 **Smart Traffic Management using CCTV Analytics**  


-> A vehicle-focused traffic mapping system that analyzes real-time CCTV footage to detect traffic density, identify peak congestion periods, and forecast urban traffic movement.  

-> This project is based on real-world traffic data collected from Nasik Smart City CCTV cameras and demonstrates how computer vision and temporal analysis can support intelligent traffic management systems.  



🔍 **Key Highlights**  

-> Real-time vehicle detection using CCTV footage  
-> Traffic density classification (Low / Moderate / High)  
-> Peak congestion identification in 10-minute intervals  
-> Temporal traffic pattern analysis across multiple days  
-> Practical use-case for smart city traffic planning  



🛠️ **Tech Stack**  

-> Python (OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)  
-> CCTV Video Analytics  
-> Machine Learning
